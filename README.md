###Inspiration
Often in our lives, we are surrounded by boring ads. This is a sad fact as tremendous amount of money is being wasted for ineffective advertising. For this reason, we decided to create Spegill - an interactive web application capable to remembering aspects of user's life by having simple verbal conversation and advanced facial recognition algorithms. Using Indico, Wit.ai and Face++'s API along with Flask and node.js, we aspired and have created an intuitive AI with machine learning.

###What it does
Spegill is capable to determining a user's characteristics and preferences using machine-learning. As well, it is capable of remembering each user based on facial recognition without the need to register or authenticate. The web app is able to determine and record all sorts of data about the user's preference without the need of typing anything at all. This enables Spegill to show relevant advertisement on the fly as user walks by a Spegill enabled banner.

###What's next for Spegill
We plan to integrate a full advertisement system that will effectively choose interesting ads for each user. We hope to make the interface completely hands free in the future as well with more fluid interactions.
